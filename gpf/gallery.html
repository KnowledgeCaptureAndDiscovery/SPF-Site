Fulweiler (Boston University) and Yolanda Gil (University of Southern California) photographed with the most recent model of the Alvin deep sea submersible as they toured the facilities at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).  First launched in 1964, Alvin has received many upgrades that enable it now to take now to take a pilot and two scientists  as deep as 6,000 meters for up to 10 hours.  Over the last 50 years, Alvin has been a key compoennet of some of the most iconic deep sea discoveries, including observing extreme life, exploring the first known hydrothermal vents, and surveying the sites of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and of the RMS Titanic.</div>

<h2>CEDAR Plenary Session  Summer 2017</h2>
<p>A plenary session on the Geoscience Paper of the Future was held at the annual meeting of the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program funded under NSFâ€™s Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences division.  The session was arranged as a collaboration between the Integrated GeoSpace Observatory (InGeO) and the OntoSoft projects.  Yolanda Gil (University of Southern California) discussed the use of the community-wide Madrigal data repository and the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) to support reproducible research, open science, and digital scholarship in geospace studies.  A special session to discuss recommendations for the community was also held at the meeting, where a working group was formed to follow up on documenting the recommendations and gather community feedback.</p>
