First launched in 1964, Alvin has received many upgrades that enable it now to take now to take a pilot and two scientists  as deep as 6,000 meters for up to 10 hours.  Over the last 50 years, Alvin has been a key compoennet of some of the most iconic deep sea discoveries, including observing extreme life, exploring the first known hydrothermal vents, and surveying the sites of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and of the RMS Titanic.</div>
